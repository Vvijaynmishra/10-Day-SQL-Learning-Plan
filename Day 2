SQL Data Manipulation (DML) Overview
SQLâ€™s DML (Data Manipulation Language) allows you to modify data within tables. Common DML statements include:

INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE: Removes records from a table.


  Basic DML Commands
INSERT INTO
  INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
Exmaple:
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date) 
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15');
UPDATE:
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
Ex:
UPDATE employees SET first_name = 'Jane' WHERE employee_id = 1;
DELETE FROM:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
ex:
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 1;

The WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is essential for targeting specific rows.
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;

  Practical Exercises
Insert Data into the employees Table:

Add multiple employee records with varying hire dates.
Update Data in the employees Table:

Change the last name of an employee.
Update hire dates for employees hired before a certain date.
Delete Data from the employees Table:

Remove an employee record based on employee_id.
Challenge:

Try using WHERE with conditions like AND, OR, >, < to target specific records.
