                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Notes for Mishra Tech Hub 
Objectives 
* Understand the fundamentals of SQL.
* Learn basic SQL syntax and database structure.
* Create a simple database and a table.
  What is SQL?
* Structured Query Language (SQL): A standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases.
* Key Functions:
    * Querying data
    * Inserting records
    * Updating existing records
    * Deleting records 
Importance of SQL
* Essential for data analysis, application development, and database management.
* Enables efficient data manipulation and retrieval from databases.




Overview of Databases
* Relational Databases: Store data in structured tables that can be linked through relationships (e.g., primary and foreign keys).
* Common Database Management Systems:
    * MySQL: Open-source and widely used for web applications.
    * PostgreSQL: Open-source with advanced features.
    * SQLite: Lightweight, serverless database ideal for smaller projects.
    * Microsoft SQL Server: A robust system commonly used in enterprise environments.



                                                                                Basic SQL Syntax

Types of SQL Statements
1. Data Query Language (DQL): Used to query data.
    * Example: SELECT
2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used to manipulate data.
    * Examples: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3. Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define and manage database structures.
    * Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP
    * 
Common SQL Data Types
* INT: Integer values
* VARCHAR(n): Variable-length string, where n specifies the maximum length
* DATE: Date values
* FLOAT: Floating-point numbers for decimal values



                                        Practical Exercises


Setting Up Your Environment

* Install a SQL Database: Choose a DBMS (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) and follow the installation instructions.
* Use a SQL Client: Connect to your database using clients like DBeaver or MySQL Workbench.
Creating a Database and Table

1. Create a Database:  CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;   
2. Use the Database:  USE your_database_name;  
3. Create a Table:  CREATE TABLE users ( user_id INT PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50), email VARCHAR(100), created_at DATE );  Practical Exercises 
* Setting Up Your Environment:
    * Install a SQL Database Management System (DBMS) of your choice (SQLite, MySQL, etc.).
    * Use a SQL client like DBeaver or MySQL Workbench to connect to your DBMS. 
* Hands-on Exercise:
    * Follow these steps:
        1. Create a new database named mishra_tech_hub.
        2. Switch to that database.
        3. Create a table named employees with the following columns:
            * employee_id (INT, Primary Key)
            * first_name (VARCHAR(50))
            * last_name (VARCHAR(50))
            * hire_date (DATE)
 	◦	CREATE DATABASE mishra_tech_hub;
    * USE mishra_tech_hub;  
    * CREATE TABLE employees (
    *     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    *     first_name VARCHAR(50),
    *     last_name VARCHAR(50),
    *     hire_date DATE
    * );    Recap and Questions
* Recap:
    * You learned about SQL and its importance, the basics of relational databases, and how to set up your environment.
    * You also practiced creating a database and a table using SQL syntax.
* Questions to Consider:
    * What are the different types of SQL statements, and how do they differ?
    * Why is it important to choose appropriate data types when creating tables?
    * How can relationships between tables enhance data management?
* Next Steps
In the next session, we will explore data manipulation with SQL, including how to insert, update, and delete records in your newly created tables.   You're welcome!
